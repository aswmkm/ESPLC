This file contains a brief list of the most important work that requires doing for this project. The list below will likely serve as a means of keeping track of various things as they come to mind, and do not necessarily represent the entirety of the project at large. Thus, this list is subject to change as the project evolves. 
With regards to the scope of the project as it pertains to the demonstration for the Senior Design (2) section for Missouri S&T, some features may not be implemented. 
-Andrew Ward

				-------- TODO: --------

- Oneshot (ONS) type ladder object
	- This pulses high for one scan cycle, then holds low until reset (state change on next scans).

- Status page for individual objects, showing the values for associated bits.

- Sleeker look for web UI (css style editing).

- Finish implementing basic math objects.

- Implementation of remote ESPLC (IO expander/cluster mode) and related ladder objects. **Andrew may use this for another project or EE5430

- Write the documentation for the project, noting all functions and possible awrguments/types/etc.

- Finish implementing variable objects.

- Finish support for analog inputs and outputs.

- Finish IO expansion via network interface between ESPLC devices.

- Implement OTA (over the air) updating.

- Implementation of uploader for files (CSS/JS) to local file system. 

- Allow for declaration of inline objects (for basic math comparisons, etc.). 
		- Inline declaration syntax INPUT(NAME,PIN,ARGS). 
		- Additional attempts to declare a new object of the 		same name will result in a failure. 
		- Simple objects do not require a name, but may be assigned one.
